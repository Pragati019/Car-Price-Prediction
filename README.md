# Car Price Prediction

Problem statement-

The basic problem is to find out good regression model that can give the accurate price for the vehicle.In order to solve this, the data of the car with their attributes and re-sell prices is provided. The attributes of the car being independent variables or input while price being the dependent variable or output.We have to find the unknown function that explains the relationship between them.

Here, I have implemented application of supervised machine learning techniques to predict the price of used cars. Different techniques like Simple Linear Regression Analysis, Support Vector Machines (SVM) have been used to make the predictions. The predictions are then evaluated and compared in order to find the algorithm which provides the best performance.
